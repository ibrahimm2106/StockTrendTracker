# StockTrendTracker

## 📌 Project Overview
StockTrendTracker is a **Java-based stock price comparison web application** that allows users to track and compare stock prices in real-time. The system fetches stock price data from the **Alpha Vantage API**, stores historical data for offline access, and visualizes stock performance through interactive charts.

This project follows **Simple Architecture Principles**, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability. It is designed to work efficiently by implementing caching strategies, optimizing API requests, and offering a user-friendly interface for investors and financial analysts.
