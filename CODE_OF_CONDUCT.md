When and How to Use These Guidelines

These guidelines outline the expected conduct for all members involved in the StockTrendTracker project. They are designed to complement our Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policies, providing protections and a framework for behavior for all project contributors and stakeholders.

Expected Behavior

All members of the StockTrendTracker community are expected to:

Be Respectful

Use respectful language and manners, consider different perspectives, and provide prompt and constructive feedback without personal attacks.

Be Direct but Professional

Express honest opinions about ideas presented; disagree respectfully, providing constructive criticism and alternative solutions where possible.

Be Inclusive

Engage diverse viewpoints actively and inclusively. Support and encourage underrepresented voices to share their ideas and perspectives.

Understand Different Perspectives

Approach discussions with an open mind, aiming to enhance and elevate ideas rather than dominate the conversation.

Appreciate and Accommodate Diversity

Recognize and respect personal and cultural differences which may be reflected in communication styles, work habits, or values. Strive to eliminate personal biases and consider the diverse needs of others.

Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

Violence and Threats of Violence

No form of violence or threats will be tolerated, whether online or offline. This includes inciting violence or harm towards any individual or group.

Personal Attacks

Conflicts should remain professional and not escalate into personal or psychological attacks.

Derogatory Language

Language that discriminates or demeans an individual or a group on the basis of their characteristics will not be accepted. This includes intentional misgendering or use of derogatory terms based on any of the listed diversity aspects.

Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

No form of unwelcome sexual attention, jokes, or imagery is acceptable, nor is any unwanted physical contact.

Disruptive Behavior

Disruptions in meetings or other collaborative environments, including over-talking, non-constructive criticisms, or influence that breeds hostility, are not permitted.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violations may result in expulsion from the project and related forums, or in severe cases, legal action.

Reporting

If you observe or experience behavior contrary to these guidelines, report it to our community leads immediately to facilitate a prompt and effective resolution.
